# backendPractice
Practice backend. Routes, models, config (global variables). Also working with MongoDB. 
Some of the models include users, posts, profile, auth. Strictly backend work, no client side.

---

For now it can only register users to the mongoDB, using postman try:

Content-type || applicantion/json

{
  "name": "john",
  "email": "john@gmail.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
