# backendPractice
Practice backend. Routes, models, config (global variables). Also working with MongoDB. 
Some of the models include users, posts, profile, auth. Strictly backend work, no client side.

For now it can only register users to the mongoDB, using postman try:

Header: Content-type || applicantion/json

Raw: 
{
  "name": "john",
  "email": "john@gmail.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
